# Manuscript API

ðŸ“œ Image to text software as a service

## Installation
To install this API you will need the following dependencies:

1. Git
2. Docker

After you have both installed you can just do the following sequence of commands from your preferred workspace:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ulissesferreira/manuscript-api.git
cd manuscript-api
docker-compose build
```

Since we use Docker all the internal dependencies are taken care of there

## Running

Here we run the previously built images

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Production

ðŸš§ Under construction ðŸš§
